The MuNCHER is an acronym for **Multidirectionally Navigable and Computationally Helmed Exploratory Rover.** 

Our idea is to create a robust robotic vehicle that navigates [Parcel B]() and performs a variety of functions. It is inspired by existing projects like the Mars Curiosity Rover and FPV RC Cars. Below is a table that details our ideation into each of the different required categories for the project, and whether each idea is a reach goal or an MVP goal.

### Electromechanical and software requirements
In our initial project proposal we outlined our MVP (by week 2), our goal (by week 6), and stretch features we'd like to add if we reach our goal early. 

One of the requirements of PIE is to create a project with a non-trivial electrical, mechanical, and software system so our group brainstormed how we'd complete this:

| Table      | MVP                                                        | Goal                                                        | Reach                                                     |
|------------|------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Mechanical | - Working Drivetrain <br> - Robust Suspension System to go over obstacles in Parcel B | - Soil Sampling Mechanism <br> - Aesthetic Pieces to make MuNCHER look like a decided Rover design | - Robotic arm claw mechanism <br> - Shooting Mechanism    |
| Electrical | - Sufficiently wired to support driving forward and backward | - Implement LED Lights                                      | - Controllable LEDs based on sensor input <br> - Integrated sensors for 360 FOV |
| Software   | - Driven by live inputs from remote controller             | - First Person View Controllability with VR headset         | - Computationally-Aided Driving (alerts about nearby objects) <br> - LLM Commands |
